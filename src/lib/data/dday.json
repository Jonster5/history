	"b": "The United States’ 82nd and 101st airborne divisions landed behind German lines in difficult terrain and with much opposition just hours before the main assault. Despite this, they were able to secure their objective. The British 6th airborne division achieved similar success but suffered fewer casualties due to a less flooded landing zone. The sacrifices of these paratroopers will allow more soldiers to move with increased safety into the heart of German occupied France.",

	"d": "The Allied armies are reaching the very edge of Germany’s defensive works that they had claimed to be nigh impenetrable. Taking control of the bunkers will push the Germans back far enough to allow the Allies to create a beachhead and make preparations for a true assault into Nazi controlled land. The enemy lies just ahead, prepare yourself to take them on.",
	"e": "The enemy lies just ahead, prepare yourself to take them on.",
	"f": "Press space to shoot in the direction you're facing."
